Hydrogen Production Method Risks
Comprehensive safety risks and considerations for different hydrogen production methods. Each process presents unique challenges and safety requirements.

Fossil Fuel Processes
Fossil Fuel Processes
Steam Methane Reforming runs at high temperatures and pressures with three main flammable and explosive gases: CH4, CO, and H2.

Toxic substances produced from various processes, including desulfurization and steam conversion.

Thermochemical
Thermochemical
Thermochemical processes operate at extreme temperatures, often close to or above 1000°C, increasing the risk of burns, equipment failure, and explosions.

High heat and chemical reactions can produce harmful byproducts such as carbon monoxide, sulfur compounds, and nitrogen oxides, which are dangerous to health and the environment.

While hydrogen is the desired end-product, the process can also generate hazardous gases or require dangerous feedstocks, complicating safe production.

Electrolysis
Electrolysis
During startup, shutdown, or ageing, hydrogen and oxygen can mix in dangerous concentrations, creating flammable mixtures that pose a risk of explosions if carried downstream.

Electrolysis cells can retain electrical charge for hours after shutdown due to trapped gases, creating hazards for service personnel.

Strong ventilation and non-sparking auxiliary equipment are required to manage leaks safely, as electrolysis units are often installed in non-classified areas.

Systems must be weather-protected when installed outdoors, with hydrogen and oxygen vents carefully separated to prevent accumulation and avoid potential hazards.

Photolytic
Photolytic
The operating conditions aren't as harsh as other methods. Most risk comes from hydrogen being produced, and the materials of construction.

Generation of oxygen and hydrogen occurs in the same area, which can produce oxyhydrogen - referring to when hydrogen and oxygen is produced stoichiometrically - can lead to explosive conditions.

Biomass
Biomass
Many common hydrogen issues affect the biomass gasification process for producing hydrogen. This includes hydrogen embrittlement and permeation.

Gasification product can autoignite at higher temperatures, if some air is added to it. Additionally, ignition sources can arise from equipment within the gasification setup, static electricity, or hot work procedures.
