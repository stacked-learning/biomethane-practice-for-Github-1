Product
As decarbonisation efforts continue, biomethane is increasingly recognised as a practical option for replacing conventional fossil fuels in fuel-dependent industrial applications, particularly gas turbines. Its composition being the same as natural gas enables meaningful emissions reduction while continuing to make use of existing assets.
In the product section, we will explore:
Why biomethane is being considered as a viable decarbonisation pathway
Where it can be employed in tandem with existing infrastructure
How biomethane differs from other low-carbon fuel options such as hydrogen and natural gas (methane gas)
Process
The value of biomethane as a green fuel is closely tied to how it is produced. By converting organic waste streams into usable energy, biomethane supports a circular economy approach that improves resource efficiency across multiple sectors.
In the process section, we will explore:
How biomethane is produced
The different feedstocks used in its generation
The role of biogas, and how it differs from biomethane
Transport
For biomethane to be effectively deployed at scale, suitable transport infrastructure is essential. A key advantage is that, in many cases, existing gas networks and technologies can be readily leveraged, accelerating adoption and reducing the need for entirely new systems.
In the transport section, we will explore:
The key methods used to transport biomethane
The advantages and limitations of each approach
Existing technologies and infrastructure that can be exploited
Storage
Biomethane can be stored using a range of established and emerging gas storage technologies. These approaches are largely aligned with conventional natural gas storage practices, allowing biomethane to be stored using well-understood methods and infrastructure from across the gas industry.
In the storage section, we will explore:
Current and emerging methods for storing biomethane
The benefits and drawbacks of each storage option
Key safety, operational, and training considerations
